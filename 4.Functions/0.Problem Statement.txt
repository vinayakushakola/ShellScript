Functions
->	Functions in Bash Scripting are a great way to
   reuse code.
	Think of a function as a small script within a
   script. It's a small chunk of code which you may
   call multiple times within your script. They are
   particularly useful if you have certain tasks which
   need to be performed several times.

Problem Statement

1. Help user find degF or degC based on their Conversion Selection. Use
   Case Statement and ensure that the inputs are within the Freezing Point (
   0 °C / 32 °F ) and the Boiling Point of Water ( 100 °C / 212 °F )
	a. degF = (degC * 9/5) + 32
	b. degC = (degF – 32) * 5/9
2. Write a function to check if the two numbers are Palindromes
3. Take a number from user and check if the number is a Prime then show
   that its palindrome is also prime
	a. Write function check if number is Prime
	b. Write function to get the Palindrome
	c. Check if the Palindrome number is also prime
