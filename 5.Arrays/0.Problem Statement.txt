What is Arrays?
-> An array is a systematic arrangement of the
   same type of data.
   But in Shell script Array is a variable which
   contains multiple values may be of same type
   or different type since by default in shell script
   everything is treated as a string.
   An array is zero-based i.e. indexing start with 0.

Problem Statement
