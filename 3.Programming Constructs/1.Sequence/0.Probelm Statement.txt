1. Use Random Function (( RANDOM )) to get Single Digit
2. Use Random to get Dice Number between 1 to 6
3. Add two Random Dice Number and Print the Result
4. Write a program that reads 5 Random 2 Digit values , then find their
   sum and the average
5. Unit Conversion
   a. 1ft = 12 in then 42 in = ? ft
   b. Rectangular Plot of 60 feet x 40 feet in meters
   c. Calculate area of 25 such plots in acres
6. Write a program that takes a date as input and prints the day of the week
   that date falls on. Your program should take three command-line arguments:
   m (month), d (day), and y (year). For m use 1 for January, 2 for February, and
   so forth. For output print 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, and so
   forth. Use the following formulas, for the Gregorian calendar (where /
   denotes integer division):
	• y0 = y − (14 − m) / 12
	• x = y0 + y0/4 − y0/100 + y0/400
	• m0 = m + 12 × ((14 − m) / 12) − 2
	• d0 = (d + x + 31m0 / 12) mod 7
