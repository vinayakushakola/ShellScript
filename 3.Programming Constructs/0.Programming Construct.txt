3. Programming Constructs Classification?
-> 1. Sequences
   2. Selection
   3. Repetition

1. Sequence Statement
	A sequence construct tells the CPU (processor)
   which statement is to be executed next.  

2. Selection Statement
	a. A selection statement provides for selection
	between alternatives
	b. A program can take certain route
	depending on a situation and selection
  	statements help in choosing between the
  	routes.
2. Selection Statement Types
	a. If statements
	b. Case Statements
	c. Pattern Matching

3. Repetition Statement
	A repetition construct causes a group of one or
	more program statements to be invoked
  	repeatedly until some end condition is met.
3. Repetition Statement Types
	1. Fixed count loops - repeat a predefine number
	   of times.
	   for (( … )) do done
	2. Variable count loops - repeat an unspecified
	   number of times.
	   while [ … ] do done
